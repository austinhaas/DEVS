# DEVS

A discrete-event simulation system based on the DEVS formalism.

This is my personal implementation of Dynamic Parallel DEVS with Ports. It is
based on my interpretation of the literature. I've tried to make it functional
and efficient.

## Usage

This is intended to be used as a library and SDK.

See the docstrings for documentation.

See the tests for example usage.

See [this namespace](./src/pettomato/devs/examples.cljc) for example models.

See [these notes](./doc/notes.org) for more information on the implementation.

### Logging system

A flexible logging system can be used to trace a simulation.

See [pettomato.devs.trace](./src/pettomato/devs/trace.cljc) and [pettomato.devs.trace-format](./src/pettomato/devs/trace_format.cljc).

## Development

Run `make` to display available commands.
